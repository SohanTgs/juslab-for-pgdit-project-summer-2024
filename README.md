JusLab is an AI-based chatbot made to support students, faculty members, and applicants of the PGDIT program at Jahangirnagar University. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to give fast and accurate answers through an easy-to-use, voice-enabled interface.



The PGDIT program had issues with handling the same types of student questions over and over again. This caused slow response times and more pressure on the administration. JusLab helps solve this by giving automatic support 24/7 for common academic queries.



The main goals of JusLab are to quickly answer questions about PGDIT topics like admission, course structure, and faculty, improve user experience with voice support, and reduce the burden on staff by managing repeated questions.



JusLab uses a multi-step question-matching method that combines keyword search and understanding of meaning through Sentence Transformers. Itâ€™s built with Django for the backend and Bootstrap 5 for a mobile-friendly, responsive design.



By making it easier to get important academic information, JusLab improves the experience for students and helps the program run more smoothly through better communication.
